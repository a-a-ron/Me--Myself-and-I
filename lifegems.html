        <h3>Life Gems</h3>
        <p>I thought it would appropriate to include a page dedicated to Life Gems i've found along the way. The transition to becoming a successful person is measured in so many different ways because we all have different views of what success really is. My goal is that someone, somewhere, who stumbles accross my page can be inspired is some way to better their life. I believe that these three sections perfectly define my definition of success and I hope that something may inspire you to reach that extra goal to achive your ideal definition.</p>

        <h3>The Ten Thousand Hour Rule</h3>
        <p>In the book Outliers, author Malcolm Gladwell says that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. How does Gladwell arrive at this conclusion? And, if the conclusion is true, how can we leverage this idea to achieve greatness in our professions? Gladwell studied the lives of extremely successful people to find out how they achieved success. This article will review a few examples from Gladwell’s research, and conclude with some thoughts for moving forward.</p>

        <h3>Violins in Berlin</h3>
        <p>In the early 1990s, a team of psychologists in Berlin, Germany studied violin students. Specifically, they studied their practice habits in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. All of the subjects were asked this question: “Over the course of your entire career, ever since you first picked up the violin, how many hours have you practiced?” All of the violinists had begun playing at roughly five years of age with similar practice times. However, at age eight, practice times began to diverge. By age twenty, the elite performers averaged more than 10,000 hours of practice each, while the less able performers had only 4,000 hours of practice. The elite had more than double the practice hours of the less capable performers.</p>

        <h3>Natural Talent: Not Important</h3>
        <p>One fascinating point of the study: No “naturally gifted” performers emerged. If natural talent had played a role, we would expect some of the “naturals” to float to the top of the elite level with fewer practice hours than everyone else. But the data showed otherwise. The psychologists found a direct statistical relationship between hours of practice and achievement. No shortcuts. No naturals.</p>

      <h3>Sneaking Out to Write Code</h3>
      <p>You already know how Microsoft was founded. Bill Gates and Paul Allen dropped out of college to form the company in 1975. It’s that simple: Drop out of college, start a company, and become a billionaire, right? Wrong.</p>

      <p>Further study reveals that Gates and Allen had thousands of hours of programming practice prior to founding Microsoft. First, the two co-founders met at Lakeside, an elite private school in the Seattle area. The school raised three thousand dollars to purchase a computer terminal for the school’s computer club in 1968.</p>

      <p>A computer terminal at a university was rare in 1968. Gates had access to a terminal in eighth grade. Gates and Allen quickly became addicted to programming.</p>

      <p>The Gates family lived near the University of Washington. As a teenager, Gates fed his programming addiction by sneaking out of his parents’ home after bedtime to use the University’s computer. Gates and Allen acquired their 10,000 hours through this and other clever teenage schemes. When the time came to launch Microsoft in 1975, the two were ready.</p>

        <h3>Connecting the Dots Looking Back</h3>
        <p>
          "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life." - <em>Steve Jobs</em>

        <h3>The Strangest Secret</h3>
        <p>
          Do you know what will happen to 100 individuals who start even at the age of 25, and 
          who believe they will be successful? By the age of 65, only five out of 100 will make 
          the grade! Why do so many fail? What happened to the sparkle that was there when 
          they were 25? What became of their dreams, their hopes, their plans ... and why is 
          there such a large disparity between what theses people intended to do and what they 
          actually accomplished? That is ... The Strangest Secret. 
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we have to define success and here is the best definition I’ve ever been able to 
          find: “Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.”</p>
        <p>
          A success is the school teacher who is teaching because that’s what he or she wants to 
          do. A success is the entrepreneur who start his own company because that was his 
          dream — that’s what he wanted to do. A success is the salesperson who wants to 
          become the best salesperson in his or her company and sets forth on the pursuit of that 
          goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          A success is anyone who is realizing a worthy predetermined ideal, because that’s 
          what he or she decided to do ... deliberately. But only one out of 20 does that! The rest 
          are “failures.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered why so many people work so hard and honestly without ever 
          achieving anything in particular, and why others don’t seem to work hard, yet seem to 
          get everything? They seem to have the “magic touch.” You’ve heard people say, 
          “Everything he touches turns to gold.” Have you ever noticed that a person who 
          becomes successful tends to continue to become more successful? And, on the other 
          hand, have you noticed how someone who’s a failure tends to continue to fail?
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference is goals. People with goals succeed because they know where they’re 
          going. It’s that simple. Failures, on the other hand, believe that their lives are shaped 
          by circumstances ... by things that happen to them ... by exterior forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is The Strangest Secret! Now, why do I say it’s strange, and why do I call it a 
          secret? Actually, it isn’t a secret at all. It was first promulgated by some of the earliest 
          wise men, and it appears again and again throughout the Bible. But very few people 
          have learned it or understand it. That’s why it’s strange, and why for some equally 
          strange reason it virtually remains a secret. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcus Aurelius, the great Roman Emperor, said: “A man’s life is what his thoughts 
          make of it.”
