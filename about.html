        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Well, let’s start here. I began “seriously” learning to code during the fall of 2013. I had taken some college programming courses earlier but i hated the common core those courses seemed to follow and I didn’t seem to grasp the nerd life. What made it worse was that i didn’t feel like what i was learning was relevant to real-world scenarios and that i was somewhat wasting my time and money.</p>
        <p> I was then introduced to <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank" class="treehouselink">Treehouse</a>, an online code school that made all the difference and was a major game changer! For the first time, coding started to make sense and what i was learning was applicable to what i would be doing outside of school. Coding has become something i LOVE to do and i think about it constantly. </p>
        <p>The amazing thing about coding is you can create applications and programs that change the way people interact with the world. Being able to create something that someone can use to change their life in a positive way is my goal in every project i do. I don’t see a better way to leave your mark in society than to improve the way people perform their daily tasks.</p>
        <p>That is why i code.</p>
        <p>But, there's more to me than my new love of coding. I'm a father of two and a husband to the most amazing woman. I’m also an outdoor enthusiast, sports fanatic, avid listener to the RadioLab podcast and huge fan of the food channel. </p>
